# CNN-Gabor-on-MNIST-dataset
Creating and testing a Gabor kernel image classifier and CNN on the MNIST dataset

## Files

### gabor_MNIST implementation

A notebook containing the code for an image classifier using Gabor kernels, as well as a convolutional neural network. Both algorithms use a subset of the MNIST dataset.

### save_MNIST_as_images

A notebook used for saving the (numpy array) MNIST dataset used for the gabor kernel algorithm as images. The images are saved into the MNIST_sample folder. 

### MNIST_sample folder

A folder containing the MNIST hand-written digit images used for the training and validation of the CNN
